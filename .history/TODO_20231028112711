 <!-- ## Instructions -->
 
 TODO: To start off with, you will use a [bootstrap card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#header-and-footer) to have your sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process (by clicking on a button). The form should not be on the DOM until the button click happens. -->
TODO: A [bootstrap form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/) will then appear to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This should then assign the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin).
<!-- TODO:  On sorting a student, the form should clear and a [bootstrap card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) with the student's name and a random house assignment should print below the form.  -->
<!-- TODO: You should also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted, which should remove their card from the student array and move them to Moldy Voldy's Army.



 <!-- Technical Requirements -->
TODO: You MUST plan your project and highly suggest using issue tickets. There are a few that have been provided for you to use already. Continue to add to these so you know what work you need to complete. 
TODO: You MAY use the `renderToDom()` function that we worked on in class, but you also need to be able to explain it if you use it.
TODO: you have to create a data structure for your project. Review all the elements that need to be on the DOM and create the structure accordingly
TODO: You must use [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style your page components
TODO: You must use a loop other than a `for loop`
TODO: Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function except for your initial `startApp()` function
TODO: Your code MUST be YOUR code. Do not copy and paste code into your project. Type every bit of it out
TODO: Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentation
TODO: Helpful Form: An error message shows if a user tries to sort a student without filling out the form
TODO: Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently from Hogwarts students.
TODO: Add filter buttons to filter the non-expelled students by house
