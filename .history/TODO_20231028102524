 <!-- ## Instructions -->
 
 TODO: To start off with, you will use a [bootstrap card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#header-and-footer) to have your sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process (by clicking on a button). The form should not be on the DOM until the button click happens.
TODO: A [bootstrap form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/) will then appear to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This should then assign the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin).
TODO:  On sorting a student, the form should clear and a [bootstrap card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) with the student's name and a random house assignment should print below the form. 
TODO: You should also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted, which should remove their card from the student array and move them to Moldy Voldy's Army.



 <!-- Technical Requirements -->
TODO: You MUST plan your project and highly suggest using issue tickets. There are a few that have been provided for you to use already. Continue to add to these so you know what work you need to complete.
